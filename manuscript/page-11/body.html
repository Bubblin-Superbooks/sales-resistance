<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The platinum engraved card inside said simply:</p><p><em>A Master Salesman has chosen you for his next call.</em></p><p>Perry placed the note carefully on a plastic table. He inhaled deeply and held it for a moment to steady his nerves.</p><p>A <em>Master</em> salesman. No one of that stature had ever called upon him before. It was an honor like—like a mayor or a bishop. It meant he had attained top level on the universal measuring stick—an A-number-1-plus-plus credit rating.</p><p>The prospect should have saturated him with pleasure. But, like the sharp new music, it didn't.</p><p>This card also meant he was expected to buy something. Something big and expensive. And he didn't want or need something big and expensive.</p><p>He wished they'd leave him alone.</p><p>Perry clapped his hand to his mouth as though someone might have heard the thought.</p></div> </div>
